- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @actionphysics
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in, well, physics, and particularly simulations of physical systems. These repositories will contain code related to topics on my web site, actionphysics.uk
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning WordPress :) Long ago I spoke PDP8 assembler but my comfort zone is C.
- ðŸ“« Reach me via a comment on actionphysics.uk
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: The 1834 fire which destroyed the Palace of Westminster was caused by burning a huge quantity of old, dry Treasury tally-sticks in the new House of Commons furnace.
